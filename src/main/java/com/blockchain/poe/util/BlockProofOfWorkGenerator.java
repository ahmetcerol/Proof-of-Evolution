/**
 A Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm is a crucial component
 of blockchain technology used to create or mine new blocks.
 The primary objective of PoW is to identify a specific number
 that can solve a complex computational problem.
 This number should be challenging to find, requiring substantial computational effort,
 but once discovered, it must be effortlessly verifiable by any participant on the network.
 This fundamental concept of PoW ensures that the process of creating new blocks is secure, fair, and transparent,
 as it demands work from miners, making it difficult for any single entity to dominate the network, while still allowing
 others to quickly confirm the validity of the solution.
